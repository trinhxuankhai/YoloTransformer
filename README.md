<h1 align="center"> Combine YOLOv6 and DPText-DETR for real time text detection </h1> 

## Introduction

Outstanding results on the benchmark for text detection are achieved by DPText-DETR. However, it is unable to perform real-time inference. In order to accomplish real-time inference, I integrated [YOLOv6](https://github.com/meituan/YOLOv6), a quick and high-performance object detection network, with [DPText-DETR](https://github.com/ymy-k/DPText-DETR). Additionally, ROIAlign is employed to improve the decoder's query embedding, and a lightweight segmentation head is created to support multitask learning for even more accuracy increase.

- ### Training

**Fine-tune:**
Yolo6n network is being used in the fine-tuning model to replace the DPText-DETR encoder. When compared to the original DPText-DETR, the inference speed is tested to be 2â€“3 times faster, but the precision and recall are less accurate. On the Colab GPU, the model is fine-tuned with a batch size of 4. When the batch size is increased and the pretrained dataset is a synthetic text dataset (which it is not currently), more performance is expected. 

More detail on trainning and dataset preparation can be refered to [DPText-DETR](https://github.com/ymy-k/DPText-DETR).
